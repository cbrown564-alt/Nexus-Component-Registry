## Conclusion

## Conclusion

The Nexus Component Registry has achieved its goal of **100% 5-Star Status** across all 28 templates. Each template now features:

1.  **Dedicated Component Library**: Every template has its own set of 4-6 dedicated components, including specialized buttons.
2.  **Rich Interactions**: From neon glows to e-ink flashes, every interaction is tailored to the specific aesthetic.
3.  **Production-Ready Layouts**: Cohesive, responsive layouts that feel like complete applications rather than component showcases.

The "Engineering Dashboard" Nebula IDE redesign stands as the final capstone, proving that even technical tools can be delivered with a "Maker" vibe and premium polish. This audit confirms the registry is now a gold-standard reference for diverse UI implementation.
