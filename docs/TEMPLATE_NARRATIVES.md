# Template Narratives

*28 design systems, each with a story to tell.*

This document captures the essence of each Nexus template—not as a specification, but as an experience. These are the worlds your users will inhabit.

---

## Engineering

**The developer's sanctuary.**

You're deep in flow state at 2 AM, the glow of your monitor the only light in the room. The interface wraps around you like a familiar cockpit—file explorer on the left, tabs tracking your open modules, terminal humming at the bottom. A blue accent catches your eye: the AI copilot suggests an optimization. The monospace font doesn't apologize for being technical. This is a tool built by developers, for developers. Every pixel respects your time. The dark background isn't a design choice—it's survival. You'll be here for hours.

---

## Wellness

**Breathe in. Breathe out.**

The screen feels like morning light through linen curtains. A gentle sage-green circle pulses at the center—expanding, contracting—teaching you to breathe without saying a word. Your heart rate floats at the bottom: 72 bpm. Your sleep score from last night: 8 hours. There's nothing demanding your attention, nothing competing for clicks. The cream background doesn't strain your eyes. The organic shapes don't have sharp corners because life doesn't have sharp corners. This isn't an app. It's a moment of stillness you carry in your pocket.

---

## Education

**Progress you can see. Goals you can reach.**

Each course card is a promise: "Introduction to Machine Learning — 85% complete." The violet progress bar is almost full. You're going to finish this one. The clean slate interface doesn't distract you with gamification tricks or social pressure. It simply shows you where you are and where you're going. Two more lessons until the next certificate. The academic aesthetic whispers credibility. This is serious learning, but the percentage completion numbers make it feel achievable. One card at a time.

---

## SaaS

**The numbers that matter.**

Revenue is up 20.1%. The chart curves upward and to the right—the only direction your investors want to see. Below it, the customer table scrolls with names and MRR values. Olivia Martin just upgraded. Jackson Lee renewed. The indigo accent is professional but not boring. This isn't a dashboard for looking—it's for deciding. Every metric answers a question: "Are we growing?" The dark slate background says this is serious business. The data density says you're in control.

---

## Magazine

**Words worth reading.**

The headline stretches across the top in elegant serif: bold, confident, earned. Below it, a byline in muted gray—the author's name means something here. Text flows in columns like a printed page, because some traditions are worth keeping. The sidebar holds three more stories, each with a thick black border on the left—a typographic flag saying "this matters too." The cream background feels like quality paper. You could read this for hours. You want to read this for hours.

---

## Storefront

**Every product has a stage.**

White space isn't empty—it's expensive. The product grid breathes. Each item sits in its own clean rectangle: a structured wool coat for $450, a minimalist watch for $195. No clutter. No noise. The photography does the selling. A subtle cart sidebar tracks what you've almost committed to. The black typography is luxury's oldest trick. This isn't browsing—it's curating your taste. The promo banner at the top whispers about a limited edition. The "Add to Cart" button doesn't beg. It knows you'll click.

---

## Stream

**The feed never sleeps.**

Stories pulse at the top—glowing rings around familiar faces. Sarah just posted. The Design Daily account shared another minimalism thread. Below, posts scroll in an endless river: images, text, engagement numbers. 1,240 likes. 45 comments. The three-column layout gives you context on all sides: your profile on the left, trending topics on the right, the infinite scroll in the center. The dark background makes the content pop. Sky blue accents mark the interactions. You came to check one thing. You'll leave an hour later.

---

## Terminal

**Trust is a green number.**

Your portfolio is up 2.4% today. The emerald accent tells you before you read the number. A sleek digital card floats in the sidebar—your actual credit card, rendered in pixels. The transaction list shows money flowing: deposits in, transfers out, everything accounted for. The market ticker scrolls at the top: BTC, ETH, SPY. Red and green. The dark interface feels like a trading floor after hours—professional, focused, slightly dangerous. The "Send Money" button is ready. The quick transfer contacts are waiting. This is where money moves.

---

## Flow

**One thing at a time.**

The focus timer counts down: 25:00. Then 24:59. The amber accent glows like a candle in the dark interface. On the right, three kanban columns track your tasks: To Do, In Progress, Done. Cards move left to right as you conquer them. The sidebar lists your projects, but today you're only looking at one column: "Today." The progress bar shows 8 of 12 tasks complete. The minimal aesthetic removes every distraction. There's only the timer and the next task. Deep work happens here.

---

## Arcade

**INSERT COIN.**

Neon fuchsia screams "PLAYER ONE" at the top. Your score: 99,999. Your level: 42. The game grid pulses with scanlines—a deliberate CRT imperfection that feels like childhood. The deep purple background makes the cyan highlights radioactive. This isn't productivity software. This isn't trying to be professional. It's trying to be *fun*. The gradient bursts feel like victory screens. Every element has that 80s arcade energy: loud, confident, unapologetic. Press Start.

---

## Sonic

**The album art is the hero.**

A square of color dominates the layout—M83's "Midnight City" cover, casting its shadow across the interface. Below it, the track list scrolls: numbers, titles, durations. 3:42. 4:18. The playlist sidebar holds your collections: Chill Vibes, Gym Motivation, Coding Focus. Now Playing floats in the right sidebar, waveform pulsing. The dark gradient background fades from indigo to black. Rose and violet accents mark your place. The music is the content. The interface just gets out of the way.

---

## Crave

**Your hunger, visualized.**

Category chips scroll across the top: 🍕 Pizza, 🍣 Sushi, 🍔 Burgers. The orange accent is warm like a kitchen. Below, a banner tracks your active order: "On the way! 15-20 min." The progress steps show the journey: Confirmed → Preparing → On the way → Delivered. You're at step three. The menu grid displays photos that make you salivate—professionally lit, strategically styled. The cart sidebar tallies your damage. This interface knows you're hungry and doesn't waste time.

---

## Matrix

**The city that never sleeps.**

A map visualization fills the screen—nodes pulsing green, amber, red across a grid of streets. Sector 7 is online. Sector 4A has a pressure spike. The alert log scrolls in monospace: timestamps, types, messages. The deep blue interface feels like mission control at 3 AM. Resource gauges show power, load, temperature—all within tolerance. Control buttons wait for your command: Sync All, Boost, Failover, E-Stop. The data density is intentional. You're monitoring a living system. You need to see everything.

---

## Raw

**Design rules are for other people.**

A black bar screams "RAW DESIGN" in white uppercase. Below, asymmetric blocks refuse to align. "NO RULES" sits at an angle in the largest block. A yellow rectangle breaks the gray like a warning sign. A black rectangle sits next to it, offering no explanation. The thick borders are deliberate—brutalist architecture translated to pixels. This isn't user-friendly. It's artist-honest. The stark contrast hurts a little. That's the point.

---

## Mise

**Cooking as craft.**

Step 2 of 8 dominates the center: "Add the pasta to salted boiling water." A timer counts down in the corner: 12:45. The warm cream background feels like a farmhouse kitchen. On the left, ingredients wait with checkbox precision—pasta water, rigatoni, vodka, tomatoes. On the right, smart appliances report their status: Stovetop HIGH HEAT, Oven 375°F, Exhaust Fan AUTO. A chef's tip appears in a green card: "Save the pasta water. The starch helps emulsify." Voice command listens. This is mise en place for the digital age.

---

## Play

**Learning feels like Saturday morning.**

The sky is blue—actually blue, like a cartoon sky with fluffy white clouds drifting behind. Six big colorful squares fill the screen: Read (red), Art (yellow), Math (blue), Videos (green), Music (purple), Space (indigo). Each one is a doorway to adventure. Stars track progress in the corner—you've earned three! A friendly mascot waves from below. The touch targets are huge because little fingers need room. This isn't school. This is the playground where curiosity lives.

---

## Helix

**The future is already here.**

Hexagonal patterns tile the background like alien technology. A central HUD circle floats in the void—crosshairs tracking something you can't see. Cyan glows against near-black. Data readouts scroll in the corner: coordinates, percentages, status codes. The interface feels like you're piloting something—a starship, maybe, or a biotech scanner. Holographic effects shimmer at the edges. The future doesn't explain itself. It just expects you to keep up.

---

## Canvas

**Just the words.**

Black ink on paper-gray. A sidebar lists the chapters—stark black rectangles marking your place. The main content area holds text: clean, readable, unhurried. There's no color because color would be a distraction. There's no animation because animation would interrupt your reading. The thick black borders separate sections like pages in a book. This interface respects the written word. It respects your attention. It feels like a Kindle that went to design school.

---

## Eden

**Tomorrow grows here.**

A sun visualization glows in warm yellows and ambers—2.4 kWh generated today. The light green background feels like morning in a greenhouse. On the right, plant progress bars track your hydroponics: Basil (100% — ready to harvest), Cherry Tomatoes (65% — flowering), Romaine Lettuce (30% — vegetative). Community avatars cluster at the bottom—Sarah planted tomatoes 2 hours ago. The organic shapes have no hard edges. This is optimism rendered in pixels: a future where technology and nature aren't enemies.

---

## Eagle

**Authority on the page.**

Gray backgrounds command respect. Red accents mark importance—a color borrowed from sealing wax and judicial robes. The layout is structured like a legal document: sections, headers, formal hierarchy. Nothing is playful. Everything is deliberate. The serif typography says "this matters" in the voice of institutions that have mattered for centuries. This is where policy becomes pixels. This is where citizens meet their government.

---

## Plastic

**Soft to the touch.**

Light gray backgrounds with shadows that feel molded, not painted. Buttons appear raised—you want to press them just to feel the satisfying click. Other elements sit inset, like buttons pushed in and held. The rounded shapes feel friendly, approachable, almost squishy. This is neumorphism done right: not flat, not skeumorphic, but somewhere in between—a world where digital things have physical weight without pretending to be physical things.

---

## Pulse

**The drop is coming.**

Audio bars bounce across the screen—fuchsia and cyan alternating in an endless visualization of bass. "▶ LIVE" pulses in the corner. The black background makes the neon colors violent. This is 2 AM at the main stage, translated to interface. High energy. No chill. The gradient bursts feel like strobe lights frozen in time. You can almost hear the beat just looking at it. The festival never ends here.

---

## Acid

**Visual volume at 11.**

Lime green screams against lavender backgrounds. Thick black borders contain the chaos—barely. The aesthetic borrows from brutalism but adds color like a highlighter attacking a document. Stickers feel stuck. Marquee text scrolls. Everything is bold, nothing is subtle. This is graphic design having a panic attack—and loving every minute of it. If it doesn't make you slightly uncomfortable, you're not looking hard enough.

---

## Legacy

**A window into the past.**

The teal desktop stretches behind beveled gray windows. "Dashboard.exe" sits in the title bar—minimize, maximize, close buttons in their proper places. Another window overlaps behind it: "Statistics.exe," slightly translucent, waiting its turn. The 3D borders feel chunky in a way modern flat design forgot. This is Windows 95 reborn: nostalgic for people who were there, aesthetic education for people who weren't. Start menu sold separately.

---

## Cockpit

**Eyes on the road.**

Three gauges dominate the view: RPM on the left, Speedometer in the center (88 MPH, always), Fuel on the right. The circular instruments glow against carbon-black backgrounds. Blue needles point with precision. The typography is monospace—no room for ambiguity when lives are on the line. This isn't a dashboard metaphor. This is an actual dashboard: instruments, readings, the road ahead. The only metric that matters is the one right in front of you.

---

## Clay

**Productivity that doesn't punish.**

Soft shadows make every card feel like a sticky note that learned to levitate. The calendar strip shows the week: Monday through Friday, each day a rounded rectangle with room to breathe. Wednesday is highlighted in sky blue—that's today. Below, task cards list the mundane made manageable: Walk the dog (done), Design meeting (pending). A progress circle shows 75% completion with rounded, friendly strokes. Pastel accents mark categories: violet for work, rose for personal. This is todo-list software that wants you to succeed.

---

## Blueprint

**Precision is not optional.**

White lines cross deep blue backgrounds at perfect angles—a technical schematic rendered in pixels. Grid lines suggest measurement. Dashed lines suggest dimensions. The aesthetic borrows from architectural drawings, from CAD software, from the precise moment before something is built. Every element snaps to grid. Every proportion is calculated. This is planning before execution, design before development, the blueprint before the building.

---

## Swiss

**Less, but better.**

A red square sits in the upper left—bold, unapologetic, perfectly positioned. Below it, a black typography block announces the content. The grid is invisible but absolute: every element aligned to an underlying structure you can feel without seeing. White space isn't empty—it's compositional. The layout breathes because Müller-Brockmann would have wanted it to breathe. This is international typographic style, distilled to its essence: clarity, objectivity, and a red square that means business.
